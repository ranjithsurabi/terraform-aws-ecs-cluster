Thank you for the opportunity to work on this. I want to acknowledge that this is not my best work yet, as I put it together quickly in the time I had available. However, I look forward to discussing it in more detail during the call, where I can provide further insights into my approach, thought process, and potential improvements. I appreciate your time and consideration, and Iâ€™m excited for the conversation ahead!
